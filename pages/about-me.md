  bio: |
    I’m a rising sophomore studying Computer Science at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and I’m proud to be from the great country of Nigeria 🇳🇬.

    My passions lie at the intersection of AI and software engineering—whether that’s building intelligent prototypes for my USPTO project, contributing to hackathons like BisonHacks, or developing Flask apps like “Wakanda - Shuri’s Gauntlet.”

    On campus, I’m active in the Google Developer Club, IEEE, and the Howard University Student Council. When I’m not coding, I enjoy mentoring fellow students, playing jazz trumpet, and tinkering with Raspberry Pi and side AI projects in my free time.
