what_i_learned: |
  Today in the CEAMLS SAIRI internship, we dove deeper into using GitHub to customize our personal websites. I ran into an issue editing my About Me page but, with some help from Clyde, I was able to fix it and gain confidence in version control workflows.

  We also got to meet our faculty mentors—they were incredibly nice and offered great insights into the internship projects. In our Python 102 bootcamp session, we covered dictionaries and sets—key data structures.

  To wrap up the day, we played a guessing game (called Headbandz) where you ask yes/no questions to identify an object. I didn’t guess correctly on my turn, which was a bit of a bummer, but it was a fun way to practice logical thinking.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today—just the temporary hiccup with GitHub that was quickly resolved thanks to Clyde’s guidance.

reflection: |
  I’m pleased with how quickly I’m adapting to GitHub workflows and excited about applying dictionaries and sets in real code. Meeting the mentors was inspiring, and I’m looking forward to collaborating with them. Tomorrow, I’ll focus on deepening my Python skills and contributing meaningful updates to our group project.
