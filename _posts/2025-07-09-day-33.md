what_i_learned: |
  We continued improving our regression models by focusing on SVM (Support Vector Machines). We explored how SVMs work and tried applying GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters. Unfortunately, Google Colab ran out of virtual RAM during our tuning process, preventing us from completing the task. After several attempts at restarting the notebook, we had to pause on that front. Later, we officially began our research paper process. Ms. Grace introduced us to proper academic referencing using tools like Zotero and guided us through integrating it with our Google Docs setup. This marked our transition from just building to documenting our work in a research-ready format.

blockers: |
   Grid search failed repeatedly due to virtual RAM limitations on Google Colab, meaning we couldn’t complete SVR tuning despite code being correct.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that technical progress isn’t always linear. Despite setbacks with Colab memory limits, the deeper understanding I gained on SVMs and kernel tuning will help when we find a better environment to run our models. On the research side, this was my first structured experience with tools like Zotero and it already makes the referencing process smoother. I was tasked with drafting the introduction section of our paper, and I plan to bring our project's real-world impact and technical depth to life through my writing.
