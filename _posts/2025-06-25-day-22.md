what_i_learned: |
   We continued refining our hardware setup and focused on troubleshooting the NEO-6M GPS module. Although we briefly saw power run through it, the signal dropped, and we couldn’t regain functionality even after reconnecting. After repeated trials, we made the decision to pause GPS debugging and shift focus toward connecting the RFID reader and solar components to our ESP32 setup. During a peer session, we demonstrated our Firebase integration from the previous day, which impressed the other group and sparked a helpful discussion led by our faculty mentor on further Firebase functionalities. We explored new ways Firebase can be used, not just for logging sensor data, but also for real-time alerts, user authentication, and dynamic dashboards. Mr. Joseph, a guest introduced by our graduate mentor, gave us an insightful walkthrough of advanced machine learning topics like regression models, neural networks, and gradient descent, reinforcing the theoretical backbone of our project.

blockers: |
   Our biggest blocker today was the unreliability of the GPS module. Despite wiring it correctly and providing stable power, it stopped transmitting data after briefly working. With time constraints and little progress, we had to temporarily set it aside and move on to other circuit components to stay on track.

reflection: |
  Days like this are a reminder of how unpredictable hardware can be, even when you follow every instruction to the letter. It was frustrating to watch the GPS module blink to life for a few seconds and then fail without clear cause. Still, pivoting to the RFID and solar components will give us some breathing room, and our Firebase demo showed how far we’ve come in integrating software. Mr. Joseph’s machine learning session helped ground some of the more abstract concepts we’ve encountered in our code so far. We may not have solved the GPS issue today, but we made sure our momentum didn't stop with it.
