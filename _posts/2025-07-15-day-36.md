what_i_learned: |
  The day began with a cohort session on how different personalities and learning styles contribute to team success in research environments. We took assessments to identify our styles, then applied them during gallery presentations to reflect on our project collaboration and team accountability practices.

  Back in the lab, I resumed work on the route optimization model. Although our regression model yielded a strong R² score, the RMSE was nearly equal to the mean target value—indicating poor real-world usefulness. After analyzing the results, I decided to pivot the model’s objective. We reframed it as a classification problem and successfully trained a random forest classifier for fill level prediction.

blockers: |
   Regression model for predicting bin fill time showed poor performance despite high R².  Original model objective didn’t align well with dataset structure or distribution.

reflection: |
  Today reinforced the importance of adaptability in research. The personality and learning styles workshop helped me understand the value of self-awareness in team settings. On the technical side, identifying the mismatch between regression and our data led to a meaningful shift in approach. The classifier now gives us clearer categories for route optimization and will better support decision-making in real deployments.
