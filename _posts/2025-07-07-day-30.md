what_i_learned: |
  Today, we shifted focus toward the software and research aspects of our project. Before lunch, our grad mentor instructed us to thoroughly analyze both our Arduino code and the Google Colab machine learning code. The goal was to ensure we understood each line, especially how sensor data flows into model predictions. After lunch, we were briefed by Ms. Grace, who will be guiding us through the research paper we aim to publish. She emphasized revisiting our literature review documents to understand the expected structure of a formal paper—covering abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion. Lastly, Joseph hosted a hands-on ML session where we walked through core stages: data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. We didn’t have time to cover deployment but made solid progress.

  No major blockers today, although we ran out of time before reaching model deployment in our machine learning session.

reflection: |
  Today was a valuable reminder that strong tech projects require not only working hardware and code but also deep understanding and clear documentation. Breaking down our Arduino and ML code helped me identify gaps in my comprehension and reinforced best practices in code clarity. It also motivated me to improve how I document and comment code moving forward. Meeting Ms. Grace gave our efforts a greater sense of purpose, since the potential for publication now feels tangible. I look forward to learning how to translate all we’ve done into a compelling and technically sound research paper.
