what_i_learned: |
  I studied a machine learning overview slide deck from our graduate mentor, reviewing the key differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches. I followed a YouTube tutorial on building a simple linear regression model using `sklearn`, which predicted the salary of new hires based on experience, test scores, and interview scores. I learned how to clean data using pandas, convert word-based experience values into numbers with the `word2number` library, and fill missing values using the median strategy. I trained a linear regression model with scikit-learn, interpreted coefficients and intercepts, and made predictions with new data points. We also started the hands-on setup of our ESP32 microcontroller following a 10-day guide, with today's focus on configuring the Arduino IDE and testing the onboard LED blink function.

blockers: |
  We didn’t have a multimeter to test voltage across the breadboard, so we had to skip Step 2 of the setup process. None of our group members could detect the correct COM port for the ESP32 on our laptops, preventing us from uploading code successfully. As a result, we couldn’t complete the Blink Test or verify our hardware setup today.

reflection: |
  While we made solid progress understanding linear regression and applying it with Python, today was one of our most blocker-heavy days. The inability to connect our ESP32 devices and complete the Blink Test was frustrating, especially after carefully following all the setup instructions. That said, the ML exercise helped me feel more confident in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. I plan to revisit the port detection issue tomorrow and test alternative USB cables or laptops to isolate the problem. Despite setbacks, I’m staying optimistic and focused on combining software knowledge with working hardware soon.
