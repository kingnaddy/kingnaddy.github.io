what_i_learned: |
  We spent most of our morning working on our team video submission. It took three separate recordings to hit the 5-minute mark while still covering all the important points without rushing. Most of our hardware components were delivered today, except for the microprocessor. Unfortunately, this limited our ability to move forward with physical assembly or testing. I experimented with a basic machine learning model using Python’s `scikit-learn` library. The task was to classify motion detection based on garbage level using a Random Forest classifier. Although I struggled a bit with understanding the machine learning workflow, I got a sense of how features, target variables, model training, and evaluation all fit together.

blockers: |
  Recording the team video multiple times to meet the time limit was a bit frustrating and time-consuming. The microprocessor still hasn’t arrived, which stalled our hands-on prototyping plans. I found parts of the machine learning exercise challenging, especially interpreting the confusion matrix and classification report without much prior background.

reflection: |
  Even though today felt slower in terms of progress, recording the team video helped strengthen our collaboration for sure. While it was frustrating to redo takes, it ultimately improved the quality of our presentation. Playing around with the Random Forest model gave me a glimpse into how machine learning might help automate decision-making in our smart bin system, even if the details were a bit overwhelming at first. I’m hoping to review the Python workflow again this weekend to solidify my understanding. Once the microprocessor arrives, I’m looking forward to connecting theory with actual hardware implementation.
