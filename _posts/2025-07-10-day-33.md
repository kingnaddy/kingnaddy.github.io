what_i_learned: |
  The day began with a powerful research writing workshop led by Anita Pandey. She covered almost everything from ethical writing practices and IEEE formatting to core elements of strong academic papers—title crafting, abstract writing, result discussion, and more. I especially appreciated the focus on passive voice for credibility and proper citation to avoid plagiarism. After lunch, I finalized the training of our gradient descent linear regression and decision tree models, both tuned using GridSearchCV. I began implementing a stacking ensemble to combine the models for improved performance. Later, our faculty mentor held a strategic check-in and outlined the roadmap for the final weeks, including tomorrow’s model presentation.

  Ran out of time while building and testing the full stacking ensemble. Final tweaks postponed until after tomorrow’s presentation.

reflection: |
  Today really emphasized on both my technical and academic growth. Anita’s writing seminar was brilliant. It gave me concrete guidance for framing our research contributions with clarity and professionalism. On the technical side, seeing our optimized models come together felt like a major milestone. The ensemble modeling pushed my understanding of regression pipelines and cross-validation. I look forward to sharing our progress tomorrow—and to finishing the ensemble stack soon after.
