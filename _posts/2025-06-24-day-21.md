what_i_learned: |
   We kicked off the day with a quick Cohort Connect where we reviewed important program updates, including stipend info, the format and timing of Friday's mid-summer presentations, and slide expectations. We successfully completed the setup and testing of the MQ-135 gas sensor on the ESP32. I learned how to use analogRead to monitor voltage levels from the sensor and interpret the values through the Serial Plotter. We moved forward with the integration of the NEO-6M GPS module, wiring it to GPIO 16 (RX) and GPIO 17 (TX) on the ESP32, and installed the TinyGPSPlus library for data parsing. Although we uploaded the GPS code correctly and verified the wiring, we weren't able to receive any GPS data in the Serial Monitor. We suspect satellite lock issues and plan to debug this tomorrow. I learned how to properly configure Firebase from scratch: creating a project, setting up Realtime Database, retrieving configuration info, and creating a user for authentication. We initialized Firebase Studio accounts, installed the required Firebase ESP Client library in Arduino, and prepared for data logging by linking GPS output to the Firebase Realtime Database. This gave me valuable insight into how sensor data is not just read, but actually transmitted, stored, and visualized for real-world use cases like smart waste monitoring.

   The GPS module returned no data in Serial Monitor despite following correct setup steps. This may be due to signal or positioning issues (possibly needing to be closer to a window or outdoors).

reflection: |
  Today felt like a great step forward in integrating our software and hardware systems. Seeing the gas sensor working in real-time reassured me that we're learning to debug and apply sensor logic confidently. Although the GPS module didn't work yet, we’ve narrowed down the potential issues and know what to test next. Setting up Firebase showed me how cloud storage and IoT devices come together. It was exciting to imagine our trash bin data streaming live to a dashboard in the near future. I’m looking forward to debugging the GPS tomorrow and completing the first version of our working data pipeline.
