what_i_learned: |
    I completed an Arduino crash course, learning how to install the Arduino IDE and configure board settings for the first time. I understood the Arduino “trifecta”—hardware, IDE, and sketch code—and how they work together in a project. I learned the structure of an Arduino program, mastering the required setup() and loop() functions and basic variable declarations. I practiced connecting components virtually in TinkerCAD following tutorials for ESP32, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, gas sensor, GPS module, RFID reader, and camera module. I got my first exposure to C++ syntax through control structures and realized which genuine Arduino boards and modules are worth purchasing.

blockers: |
    Our physical hardware still hasn’t arrived yet, so we continued relying on virtual simulation in TinkerCAD. Maintaining focus during the multi-hour crash course was challenging; I needed to take regular 20-minute breaks to stay alert.

reflection: |
    Working through the Arduino crash course and hands-on TinkerCAD simulations today was both intense and rewarding—especially as a self-proclaimed software person discovering the appeal of hardware demos. I now feel confident navigating the Arduino IDE and structuring sketches with  'setup()' and 'loop()'. Experimenting virtually with each sensor module solidified my understanding of how they interface with the ESP32. Although I fought off fatigue, strategic breaks kept me productive and helped me absorb complex material. Tomorrow, I’ll draft initial firmware sketches for our Smart Dustbin prototype and order the recommended hardware components.
