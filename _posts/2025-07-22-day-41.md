what_i_learned: |
  I started the day attempting to integrate our Firebase prediction data into the live dashboard. After hours of debugging, the code ran but didn’t display the expected results on the frontend. The issue likely stemmed from mismatches between the prediction structure and what the dashboard expected.

  Midday, I shifted to leading the creation of our elevator pitch video. I pitched the core concept, drafted and revised the script with team feedback, and took on a producer/director role—coordinating all shot compositions and capturing every scene except my own. The script combined a real-world problem hook, tech walkthrough, AI demo, and a call to action—all designed to pitch our smart bin solution to a broader audience.

   Spent several hours debugging Firebase dashboard integration with no successful visual output.

reflection: |
  While the Firebase integration didn’t work out as planned, pivoting to the video project gave me a creative outlet to apply leadership and vision. It was rewarding to guide the visual narrative and condense our complex tech into a compelling pitch. I’m proud of how the team executed under tight time, and I’m looking forward to editing tomorrow and troubleshooting the dashboard later this week.
