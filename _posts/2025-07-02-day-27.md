what_i_learned: |
   Today was focused entirely on preparing for our mid-summer presentation. I worked on the Project Summary section, where I explained the core objectives of our smart waste bin system and what outcomes we expect from it. I walked through the Arduino code shown in our demo video and explained how each sensor contributes to our system’s function. I also discussed my individual progress in the program so far, reflecting on both technical growth and project contributions. Finally, I outlined the next steps for the remaining weeks of the program, including AI integration, dashboard development, and final demo prep.

blockers: |
   No major blockers today, just a tight deadline to polish and align our slides as a team.

reflection: |
  Putting together the presentation helped me connect the dots between the work we’ve done and the impact we’re aiming for. Explaining the code reminded me how much we’ve grown in managing a full sensor system. It was a little bit annoying hearing my voice in the video though, computers always make my voice sound funny. Nonetheless, I'm proud of my contributions and looking forward to finishing strong.
