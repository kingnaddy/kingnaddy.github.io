what_i_learned: |
  I was able to understand what the CEAMLS Program Structure and History More. I was able to get to know my team mates and able to establish a proper communication platform between them. We were also able to assign roles to each other for the project. I saw a preview of my task for this week given by Faculty and was able to learn a bit more about IOT in Smart waste management. I was able to learn how to utilize the Google Scholar website to find articles and to find the RIGHT ones.

blockers: |
    Finding a reliable internet connection slowed us down slightly before we could begin our literature review. I initially struggled to understand the scope of the literature review project until our faculty mentor clarified it.

reflection: |
   Today was energizing—finally meeting everyone in person helped me build rapport quickly and establish trust within the team. Seeing how IoT can transform waste collection made me excited to contribute to our project’s research phase.  Getting clarity on the literature review gave me confidence to dive into our sources tomorrow. Overall, being on campus and interacting face-to-face reinforced my commitment to this internship and the impact we can make through smart waste solutions.
