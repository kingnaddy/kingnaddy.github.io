what_i_learned: |
  We started the day with an Overleaf workshop where we learned how to structure a research paper using LaTeX, covering sections, citations, and author blocks. As a team, we created a collaborative paper template with separate .tex files for each section. I initiated the document setup and assigned sections. I’ll be writing the Introduction and Results sections. After break, I attempted to continue our machine learning work, but my HP laptop unexpectedly began a lengthy system update. I eventually interrupted it and shifted gears—creating a 3-day completion plan for my introduction section. I also used an advanced model to audit our route optimization code and pulled dashboard files to explore integrating real-time ML predictions.

blockers: |
   Major delay due to forced system updates on my laptop. Couldn't run any code or test features during the update window.

reflection: |
  Today reinforced the importance of preparation and adaptability. Despite tech delays, I stayed productive by shifting focus to writing strategy and reviewing our dashboard code. The Overleaf session gave me the technical clarity I needed for paper formatting, and I feel more confident leading the introduction and results sections. I’m also excited to explore how we can fuse our ML outputs directly into the dashboard UI.
