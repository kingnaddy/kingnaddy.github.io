what_i_learned: |
    I completed my literature review on cloud-based data storage in environmental monitoring, learning how multisource remote sensing data are aggregated across distributed data centers to improve system performance. I explored Smart Dustbin circuits virtually in TinkerCAD, gaining hands-on experience with breadboard layouts, Arduino terminology, and component connections. I identified that our project will use the ESP32 microcontroller to transmit fill-level and geolocation data to a Firebase cloud database. I learned how the TinyGPS++ library integrates with the ESP32 to capture and send real-time GPS coordinates alongside sensor readings. I studied the full workflow (hardware components, firmware, and cloud services) of our project so I can explain the Smart AI Waste Bin Management Optimization project in technical terms.

    Our physical hardware hasn’t arrived yet, so we relied on virtual simulation in TinkerCAD. While following a faculty-assigned YouTube tutorial, the Arduino setup code was locked behind a private request—viewers had to message the publisher and pay to access it. This prevented us from completing that particular circuit in TinkerCAD.

reflection: |
   Today felt like my most productive day yet. I finally wrapped up my cloud storage review and dove into prototyping the dustbin circuit. Simulating the ESP32 in TinkerCAD gave me confidence in our wiring and code before the real components arrive. Understanding how Firebase and TinyGPS++ work together to store and geo-locate data clarified the end-to-end pipeline. I’m relieved to have a clear timeline and feel equipped to start coding firmware once the hardware ships. Tomorrow, I’ll begin drafting the Arduino sketches and setting up our Firebase project structure.
