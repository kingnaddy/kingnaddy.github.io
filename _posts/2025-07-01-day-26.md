what_i_learned: |
  We worked extensively on integrating the ESP32-CAM module into our system. The ESP32-CAM works independently but integrating it with our primary ESP32 proved difficult. After testing it separately, we confirmed it functions but requires a new plan for integration. We received and assembled the battery and solar components needed for our system. The solar-powered setup was tested successfully with an LED outdoors, showing it works, although the battery still needed more time to charge. We began designing the visualization for our project using an app built with Claude. I learned more about circuit assembly (even had to improvise cutting a wire with my teeth before tools arrived). Gained confidence and appreciation for hardware systems despite not having taken a circuits class yet.

blockers: |
  The ESP32-CAM couldn’t be connected to the main ESP32 board today, which stalled our image classification integration. Solar setup wasn’t fully testable with the Arduino system yet due to battery charging time. Lack of proper tools early in the day made wiring tricky.

reflection: |
  Today was a valuable reminder that patience and flexibility are part of problem-solving. As a rising CS sophomore with no formal hardware or circuits background yet, this hands-on experience has accelerated my understanding immensely. Working with the ESP32-CAM pushed me to think more like an engineer and less like just a programmer. I also realized the importance of stepping back to gain clarity. When my teammates suggested shifting focus instead of continuing to debug endlessly, it actually led us to more progress. That balance of persistence and adaptability is a lesson I won’t forget.
