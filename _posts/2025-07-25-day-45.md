what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about the fascinating field of human-computer interaction and how brain-computer interfaces can power real-world applications like mind-controlled drones. The PhD guest speaker broke down his development journey and explained how neural signals and muscle energy can be translated into machine commands. It was inspiring to see and interact with cutting-edge tech that blends neuroscience and engineering. On the technical side, I made significant progress integrating Firebase with our dashboard, finally managing to reflect the live bin data. I also learned how to tighten Firebase's read/write rules for data security, which is crucial as we transition toward deployment.

  The limited number of bins on Firebase (just one) made it hard to visualize route optimization, which is more effective with multiple data points. Displaying predicted routes with only a single bin presents a design limitation I need to overcome creatively.

reflection: |
  It was exciting to start the day with something so different from our usual workflow. Playing with brain-controlled drones reminded me of how vast the possibilities of AI and HCI really are. Back in the lab, it felt great to finally see our bin data reflected in the dashboard interface—it proved that the Firebase-model-dashboard pipeline is getting close to completion. Although we're still limited by our dataset size, I’m confident in our progress and the roadmap ahead. Finalizing the introduction section of the paper also felt like a solid academic milestone and it’s clear we’re approaching the final stretch.
