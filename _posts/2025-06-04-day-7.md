what_i_learned: |
   I was able to finally finish my first delievarable which was a literature review on An IoT in Smart Waste Management Article. I received valuable guidance on crafting a strong research paper. I was advised to pinpoint gaps, limitations, or overlooked areas in prior studies so that our work can address those shortcomings. I learned to carefully document and compare the methodologies used in past experiments against our own planned approach. We planned our data collection strategy, agreeing to survey all counties in Maryland to determine if similar IoT waste-management solutions have been proposed or implemented. This will help us map the current landscape and identify how our research can make a unique contribution. We watched some videos on some technologies that had been created similar to the project.


blockers: |
    I didn’t face any major blockers today, although I did run into a bit of difficulty finding a suitable article for next week’s task.

reflection: |
   Today, we created a clear outline of our next steps after solidifying our literature review on an IoT in Smart Waste Management article. From the YouTube videos we watched, I was intrigued to see current innovations in the smart city space and how they might inform our project. Although we didn’t start collecting data today, finalizing our outline felt like significant progress so I'm happy. I finished reading the literature on IoT in Smart Waste Management and identified key methodological differences I’ll need to consider. Each new insight is clarifying the project’s objectives and bringing our vision into focus.
