what_i_learned: |
  Our main focus today was finding a suitable dataset for training the machine learning model that aligns with our project goals. We explored platforms like Kaggle, UCI, Data.gov, and Google Dataset Search. However, most public datasets we found were centered on image classification, which didn't match our use case. Later, we split into groups to begin testing different ML models using a synthetic/generated dataset. I worked with Dubem on applying regression models. We handled data preprocessing, feature selection, and transformation, and tested models like Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosted Regressor. We began implementing Support Vector Regressor (SVR) but didn’t finish, so we’ll resume tomorrow.

blockers: |
  Difficulty finding a relevant public dataset with the features we wanted. Incomplete implementation of the SVR model due to time constraints.

reflection: |
  The dataset search was a reminder that while there's a wealth of open data, finding one that aligns precisely with a project's objectives can be difficult. This experience pushed us to think critically about data requirements and consider generating or synthesizing datasets that fit. On the modeling side, it was rewarding to apply advanced regressors and see how feature engineering impacts performance. I’m also becoming more confident using tools like scikit-learn and better at debugging model issues. Tomorrow, we'll finalize the SVR pipeline and evaluate model performance across the board.
