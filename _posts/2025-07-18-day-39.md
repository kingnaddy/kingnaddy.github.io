  I spent most of the day reviewing the major updates I made to our Random Forest model. Later on, I was able to understand what was going with the Arduino circuit and what my teammates who were working on it the whole week had done. I tried to explore how we could add a new gas sensor feature column to the kaggle dataset we working with. After doing some probing, I found out we could either go with guessing gas readings from the temperature column or just simply generating random values. I also updated the route optimization part to factor in both bin collection urgency and distance from the depot. We recorded our weekly video as well where I handled the project summary and talked about the progress I made this week with the route optimization.

  No blockers faced today.

reflection: |
  Today was a relative calm day. I had gotten a lot done over the week so I was fine with taking a "relaxer" day. I was happy with the progress of the rest of my group members who were working on the physical layer (Arduino etc) and the research paper. We've been moving very fast and making good progress after we decided to divide and conquer. If only we had done that earlier after I brought it up weeks earlier. Now its time to deploy the model results to the dashboard itself and complete the research paper next week.
