what_i_learned: |
  We retried the ESP32 Blink Test today with help from our faculty mentor. It still didn’t work at first, but we finally diagnosed the issue—it was the USB cable, not the board or code. The second half of the day was focused on a mini-pitch competition. Our group was assigned the concept behind “ToneCheck,” an AI-powered email assistant built to detect tone, emotion, and intent in written messages. I learned that ToneCheck is designed with neurodivergent users in mind, helping avoid miscommunication and emotional overload in professional emails. Key features include tone detection, smart reply suggestions based on emotional context, and a dashboard that visualizes communication trends. We pitched the product as more affordable and inclusive than competitors like Microsoft Emma or NUACOM, and shared how it could integrate with platforms like Gmail and Outlook.

  The faulty USB cable delayed our ability to successfully complete the ESP32 setup and Blink Test again. Condensing the ToneCheck pitch into a short time limit while still explaining all the features and competitive advantages was a challenge.

reflection: |
  Today was a great reminder that sometimes the smallest hardware issue can cause the biggest delays. I'm really glad we finally figured out the USB problem. Working on the ToneCheck pitch helped me better understand how to articulate technical solutions in a business context. I was especially inspired by the product’s mission to support neurodivergent users, and I appreciated how it blends emotional intelligence with machine learning. Practicing the pitch also gave me confidence in public speaking and collaborative storytelling. I’m looking forward to seeing how these skills translate to our final project presentation.
