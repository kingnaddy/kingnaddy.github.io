what_i_learned: |
   Today, I participated in a guided tour of Morgan State’s campus facilities I learnt about where other labs and work take place in the school. With my group, I helped assign specific roles for tomorrow’s video presentation. I met with my graduate student mentor, who clarified the technical methods—particularly sensor calibration and LoRaWAN network setups—that we’ll be using in our smart waste management system. I was able to learn more about why we are doing the project we are doing. We also celebrated the birthday of a new engineer I met named Julius.

    I didn’t face any blockers today.

reflection: |
   Touring the engineering and research labs at Morgan State made me realize how well-equipped the school is to conduct innovative research. Hopefully we can take advantage of the resources available. Assigning clear roles for the video presentation gave me confidence that our group can produce an informative overview of our project. My conversation with our graduate mentor deepened my understanding of the technical methods we are using especially around sensor integration and network reliability and reinforced why our research is meaningful. Celebrating Engineer Julius’s birthday was fun, he seemed like a genuinely funny person. Overall, today made me more knowledgeable about what Morgan State University Institution offers and renewed my enthusiasm for advancing our smart waste management initiative.
