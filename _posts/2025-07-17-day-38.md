  The day kicked off with a research and presentation workshop led by Ms. Pandey. She emphasized impactful visuals, multimodal templates, audience connection, and ethical citation practices. We wrapped with a Kahoot challenge—I placed 5th out of the entire cohort. After break, I made huge strides in deploying our ML route optimization pipeline. I trained and packaged a random forest classifier with 95% accuracy. I also wrote a feature transformation function (`firebase_to_feature_row`) to convert live Firebase data into our pipeline format. This enables real-time urgency predictions for waste bins. We then simulated predictions across 100 synthetic bins with urgency labels and implemented three routing strategies: Greedy Nearest-Neighbor, Phase-by-Phase Greedy, and a flexible OR-Tools VRP setup. It's now ready for full integration.

  Limited test data from Firebase (only one real bin). The model misclassified an empty bin as "full within 1 hr" due to lack of contextual features.  Accuracy is high, but the model still lacks robust predictive power for nuanced decisions.

reflection: |
  Today was a turning point. From strong theory this morning to practical success in the lab, I finally saw our route optimization vision come to life. Getting predictions from Firebase → ML → Routing felt incredible. There's still room to improve model generalization and input reliability, but I’m proud of the end-to-end system we’ve built. Next up: testing routing in real-time and refining our final paper and presentation.
