what_i_learned: |
  I learned about what the program is going to look like a bit. I was able to learn how to create my stipend account. I refreshed my brain on the fundamentals on Git and Github.

blockers: |
  I got into a bit issue with creating my GAD stipend account but I was able to rectify. Apart from that, there were no real blockers for today

reflection: |
  The Github session was a really nice session. The Placement Test we took caught me by surpise because they announced we were taking it out of the blue. I did quite well though so it was a nice flexing of my Python muscles. I felt the instructor did a really good job in explaining the basics. It was fun getting to know my teammates and other SAIRI participants through the game and networking sessions. Awesome Day 1!!
