what_i_learned: |
  Today we filmed and presented our weekly update video. I handled the introduction, summarized our goals for the week including dataset search, collection prediction model development, regression/classification model training, and starting the research paper—and highlighted my personal contributions. I also finalized our regression model notebook by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand data structure, correlation across features, and overall model performance. I included information about model size, data transformations, and supported the internal team presentation of our regression findings.

blockers: |
  Tight timeline to complete EDA and refine the presentation materials before our regression-focused session.
 
reflection: |
  Giving the presentation helped me synthesize all the work done on our regression models into a coherent story. The EDA phase gave more insight into how each sensor contributes to waste fill level prediction. It was satisfying to communicate our technical progress while tying it into the larger goals of the smart waste system. I’m building more confidence in both technical analysis and scientific communication.
