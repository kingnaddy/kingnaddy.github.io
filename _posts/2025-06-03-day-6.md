what_i_learned: |
    I started work today by learning some cool facts in Trivia from our Faculty Advisor. Frogs can hold pee for up to eight months. The Black Box of Airplanes is actually orange. Citizens of Kentucky are required to bath once a year. This was definitely unrelated to our work but it was a fun icebreaker to start the day. Where I will probably say I learnt the most from today was from my article assignment. It was a comprehensive study on "IoT-Enabled Solid Waste Management in Smart Cities". I discovered how PBLMUs (Public Bin Level Monitoring Units) and HBLMUs (Home Bin Level Monitoring Units) use ultrasonic sensors and GPS modules to measure fill levels and geo-locations. The role of LoRaWAN for public bins and Wi-Fi for home bins in a hybrid network architecture. How sensor data are sent via MQTT through a LoRaWAN gateway or home router to a central server and visualized in a color-coded GUI. During the presentation session, my team and I brainstormed and selected a product name and logo. We justified our choices by emphasizing campus sustainability, simplicity, and brand recall.
  
blockers: |
    The only real blocker we experienced today was kinda like a creative block. It was when we were trying to come up with names for our product. We did end up finding a name but it left us little time to create a good logo design.

reflection: |
   Deeply engaging with the article’s technical details clarified exactly what hardware, communication protocols, and power budgets we’ll need to prototype on campus. Understanding how LoRaWAN and Wi-Fi integrate with MQTT to feed a GUI gave me confidence in our project’s feasibility. The competitive incentive from our graduate mentor made the naming/logo exercise extra exciting. Actually,collaborating under that friendly pressure showed how quickly we can churn out brilliant ideas with our big brains. Presenting our rationale helped sharpen my ability to communicate complex IoT architectures to a mixed audience. Tomorrow, I’ll focus on finalizing the literature review document.
