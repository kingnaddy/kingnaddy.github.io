what_i_learned: |
  I connected with my cohort during Cohort Connect, engaging in a competitive game of Taboo that reinforced the power of critical thinking and clear communication. Teaming up with half of the cohort, we successfully guessed words in Taboo under time pressure and experienced firsthand how collaboration accelerates problem solving. I discovered that informal games like Jenga, while fun, can quickly be derailes if we don’t respect balance. In the Overleaf workshop, I learned to create and edit LaTeX documents online, upload images, and format text efficiently within the web interface. I practiced integrating elements from my blog website (like previous plog posts and about mes) into a sample technical paper to solidify my documentation skills.

  I initially struggled with Overleaf’s compilation errors until I adjusted the symbolization of some characters like '&'
reflection: |
  Today’s Cohort Connect session reminded me that technical skills alone is not enough, you need good  interpersonal collaboration too. Winning Taboo felt just so rewarding because the teams I have been on so far for activities barely win anything. The Jenga mishap was a playful lesson in maintaining concentration, even when the stakes seem low. Going into Overleaf today opened a new world of professional documentation. Mastering LaTeX online will greatly streamline my project reporting and help me in future work. Reviewing our week’s work with the team reinforced how much we’ve accomplished and set a clear path for next steps. I’m energized by the cohort’s camaraderie and ready to tackle next week’s challenges with more focus and better documentation practices.
