what_i_learned: |
  I dissected each line of our Arduino sketch for our Smart Dustbin project. It helped me gain understanding on how the PIR sensor triggers the lid servo, how the ultrasonic sensor timing maps to bin fill percentage, and how the 16×2 LCD displays dynamic status messages. I saw the importance of properly defining pin modes and using different functions to convert raw echo timings into meaningful metrics. I learned how the updated alert feature integrates with the core loop to notify users when motion and fill thresholds coincide. In Python, I simulated serial data in Google Colab, using pandas to structure incoming garbage level and motion readings and matplotlib to visualize trends.

blockers: |
  There was some initial confusion over the LCD pin assignments which caused some display errors until I and Chiamanda cross-checked the wiring order.

reflection: |
  Analyzing the Arduino code line by line gave me a solid grasp of how each sensor and other components would work together in our smart bin prototype. Simulating data in Python highlighted the next steps toward real-time analytics and reminded me how crucial clean serial parsing will be. Walking through the Colab notebook made me excited about merging hardware outputs with software data insights. Tomorrow, I’ll connect our live Arduino serial feed to the Python simulation so we can move forward to the machine learning model begin.
