what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the final full day of preparation before our research program wraps up. We focused on completing and rehearsing our final presentation, ensuring each slide was polished and our messaging was clear. I worked on the “Challenges and Solutions” section, where I compiled technical obstacles and our strategies for overcoming them. I also developed the machine learning methodology and future work slides to summarize our AI component and its scalability potential. Toward the end of the day, I helped film a demo video showing the real-time dashboard in action, successfully linking our Firebase data and model predictions into a single visual narrative.

  Minor delays due to last-minute coordination across presentation sections. Syncing the dashboard and prediction timing for the demo video took a few retries.

reflection: |
  This final push was a culmination of weeks of learning, experimenting, failing, and finally building something meaningful. Reflecting on our progress while making the slides filled me with pride. Every challenge I documented was not just a hurdle but a milestone we pushed through. Helping with the demo video was especially satisfying—watching our dashboard predict and display live data tied together all aspects of the project beautifully. I'm confident in what we’ve built and excited to present it tomorrow.
