   We successfully repeated the ESP32 Blink Test today, this time with the microcontroller fully seated on the breadboard and powered via a USB-to-Serial module and proper power rails. I learned how to use a voltage divider (1kΩ and 2kΩ resistors) to safely connect the Echo pin of the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to the ESP32’s GPIO18. I followed the correct wiring schematic: VCC to 3.3V, GND to ground, Trig to GPIO 5, and Echo to GPIO 18 (initially through the voltage divider). After uploading the test code to the ESP32 and opening the Serial Monitor, we saw only 0.0 cm as the output—this suggested an error in either wiring or logic. Dr. Efe introduced us to a hardware expert named Blessing, who helped reconfigure the wiring entirely and removed the resistors. Once rewired, the sensor started functioning correctly, and we received accurate distance measurements on the Serial Monitor. We also began setting up the gas sensor circuit. While we didn’t finish the full connection due to time, we now understand its pinout and how it should be integrated with the ESP32.

   Finding the correct resistor values delayed our progress on the HC-SR04 setup. Our initial wiring (with the voltage divider) didn't produce correct readings, leading to wasted time and repeated failed tests.

  Today was a great mix of persistence, learning, and teamwork. Getting the ultrasonic sensor to finally output correct distance readings felt like a big win after running into the zero-value issue. I now understand how critical precise wiring is for microcontroller-based systems, especially when dealing with sensor voltages and GPIO logic. Blessing’s walkthrough reminded me that sometimes the best approach is to simplify and double-check the basics rather than over-engineering. Although we didn’t finish the gas sensor setup, we’re set up well for tomorrow and gaining confidence in our hands-on circuitry work.
