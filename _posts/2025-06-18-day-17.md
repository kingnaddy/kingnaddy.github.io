  For today’s special pre-Juneteenth Cohort Connect, we created and delivered a 30-second project pitch that avoided using any keywords from our actual project title. It really made us think critically about how to describe complex ideas simply and creatively. We completed a brain teaser where we ranked 15 survival items by their usefulness if stranded in a life raft in the ocean. It sparked some great debate and made me realize how differently people think under pressure. After our group pitched, we presented it again to new high school mentors, who then tried to guess what the project was about—fun to see how others interpreted our explanation. Our graduate mentors later hosted icebreaker games that helped build rapport across the cohort and gave the afternoon a lighter, more social feel. Toward the end of the day, we got back to work with a linear regression exercise using a housing dataset. We practiced reading and cleaning data with pandas, visualizing variable relationships, training a model with `sklearn`, and evaluating results with metrics like RMSE.

  Understanding how to properly encode the "furnishingstatus" categorical variable took some time andinitially caused errors in the regression model. Plotting and formatting side-by-side prediction vs. actual graphs required extra attention to make them readable and informative.

reflection: |
  Today was different, it balanced fun and productivity really well. The pitch activity helped improve my communication skills, especially how to convey technical content in a more abstract, engaging way. The housing regression lab gave me much-needed practice with multiple regression and visual analytics in Python, and though the evaluation metrics were a bit new to me, they made the results feel more concrete. I appreciated the challenge of shifting between lighthearted icebreakers and focused modeling exercises. It was a nice reminder that learning doesn’t have to be rigid, it can be collaborative and fun too.
