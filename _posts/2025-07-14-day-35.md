what_i_learned: |
  Today, we focused on building our dashboard interface, which will serve as the platform to display sensor data and deploy our prediction models. We initially tried a React + CRA setup but encountered errors due to deprecated libraries. We pivoted to a Vite + TailwindCSS build, which performed better. I learned how to troubleshoot Tailwind installation issues, adjust page layout widths, and manually initialize the Tailwind config file.

  In the second half of the day, we returned to our ML-based route optimization. We began ideating a new target variable to predict how many hours it would take for a bin to fill. Initial results produced NaN and inflated values, but we later identified the root cause and prepared for the next modeling phase.

blockers: |
  CRA-based dashboard setup failed due to deprecated code and compatibility issues. Faced major issues getting TailwindCSS to install and initialize using npx and npm. Initial ML route model produced invalid predictions due to missing preprocessing logic.

reflection: |
  Working through today’s tech stack challenges helped sharpen my debugging and frontend dev skills. Switching to Vite was a reminder to always consider performance and compatibility. The ML phase gave us insight into how improper target definitions can ruin output—valuable learning. Overall, a day of pivoting and perseverance.
