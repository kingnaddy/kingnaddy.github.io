what_i_learned: |
  After nearly a week of frustration, we finally solved the ESP32 microprocessor issue on my laptop by installing the correct driver. Seeing COM15 appear in Device Manager was a satisfying breakthrough. Once it worked on my laptop, we repeated the fix across all group members' devices—bringing everyone's setup up to speed for the first time. I learned how to wire up the ESP32 on a breadboard, though the board’s size was incompatible with the standard breadboard, so we attempted to switch to a smaller board. Unfortunately, we lacked the correct USB micro cable to continue with that alternative. We successfully recorded our weekly team video. Although we ran into alignment issues with our individual  videos and shared screen content, we managed to put together a solid final product. Reviewing the final cut of our video made me proud of how far we’ve come—not just in understanding the technical material, but in how we function as a team. We also set up Firebase Studio accounts and explored its interface to begin conceptualizing the dashboard for monitoring waste bin fill levels. It gave me a clearer view of how our data will be stored and displayed.

  The ESP32’s large size was a poor fit for the breadboard, so we couldn't fully complete the hardware setup using the smaller microcontroller due to missing USB micro cables. Synchronizing the team video layout and maintaining visual consistency took several attempts and edits.

  Today was one of the more validating days of the internship so far. Finally solving a persistent technical issue and enabling full group progress felt like a major win. Getting the ESP32 to work after so many setbacks was not only satisfying but also taught me the value of driver troubleshooting and hardware patience. Watching our video, I think we showed real growth, not just technically, but in how we communicate, coordinate, and present as a team. Setting up Firebase and tinkering with its dashboard interface made the cloud side of our project feel more real and attainable. Overall, today reminded me that persistence, teamwork, and adaptability are just as important as code or circuits.
