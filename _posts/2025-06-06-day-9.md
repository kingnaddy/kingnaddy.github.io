   Today, my group and I delivered our weekly video presentation summarizing the work we’ve done so far. We had a great time recording it, and it helped us reflect on our progress and collaboration this week. On my end, I also spent time researching cloud-based remote sensing articles related to environmental monitoring. After some searching, I found a relevant article that presents a cloud-based high-performance computing framework for efficiently processing, managing, and generating multi-source remote sensing products. The article even directly addresses the limitations of traditional systems in handling the growing volume and complexity of satellite data. I also learned that next week we’ll be moving into the hands-on stage—working with electronic components and simulating data.

    It was challenging to find a suitable research article focused on cloud-based remote sensing for environmental monitoring. The scope of some papers didn’t quite align with our project focus. One of the technical challenges we faced while recording was trimming our video down to meet the five-minute limit without losing key details.

reflection: |
   Today was somewhat productive now that I think about it. Working on the video helped reinforce our understanding of the week’s progress, and it was fun collaborating with the team creatively. Although I hit a bit of a wall while searching for the right academic article, I still came away with a better understanding of the current gaps in cloud-based environmental monitoring. I'm especially looking forward to next week’s hands-on tasks—seeing the project move into hardware and simulation feels exciting.
