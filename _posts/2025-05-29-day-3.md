what_i_learned: |
  I learned how to create and train a simple object detector using Google’s Teachable Machine interface. I also learned how to use YOLO and gained hands-on experience running the YOLO model in a Colab notebook when local storage constraints prevented a local install. I learned how to better apply logical reasoning during our Escape Room activity. I reinforced my understanding of Python data structures through targeted exercises on dictionaries and sets. I refreshed my brain and probably mastered basic file I/O operations—opening, reading, writing, and closing files in multiple small exercises.
  
blockers: |
  Local storage limits forced me to shift to Google Colab for YOLO experiments. Our Escape Room puzzle stumped us on one logic branch, so we didn’t complete it in time

reflection: |
  Exploring Computer Vision today made me eager to integrate object detection into future projects. The Escape Room highlighted the importance of clear communication in coding challenges. Tomorrow, I’ll refine my Colab workflows and build scripts that automate file I/O tasks seamlessly.
