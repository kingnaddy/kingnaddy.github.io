what_i_learned: |
  We finalized who would be presenting each slide during the midsummer symposium. I worked on the Project Summary and Next Steps slides, clearly laying out both technical goals and future milestones. The Project Summary included objectives like real-time bin monitoring, gas level alerts, and cloud integration for AI-driven route optimization. The Expected Outcomes slide explained our goals for prototype success, cost reduction, early gas detection, and scalability. The Next Steps section outlined what’s planned for the next few weeks including AI training, dashboard deployment, multi-sensor fusion, and route optimization. We conducted a full demo of our integrated system including GPS, RFID, ultrasonic, gas sensor, and Firebase logging. Despite our progress, we couldn’t move forward with solar integration because we lacked materials and mentor support today.

blockers: |
  We still don’t have the Li-ion battery and other components needed for the solar panel integration. Mentors were unavailable so we couldn’t get assistance or parts to test solar power supply setup.

reflection: |
  Today was a relatively low-impact day due to not being able to make progess with our electronic components. Writing and presenting our goals forced me to look at our project from a big-picture perspective and I was genuinely impressed with how much we’ve done. Our full system demo worked as planned and seeing the real-time sensor data stream to Firebase tied everything together. I’m looking forward to refining the AI and dashboard components because that will really elevate the system. Once solar is integrated, we’ll have a self-contained smart bin that’s almost ready for real-world use.
