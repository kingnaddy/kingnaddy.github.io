what_i_learned: |
   We successfully connected and tested the RC522 RFID reader with our ESP32 board after commenting out the Wi-Fi and Firebase portions of the code that were causing issues due to limited connectivity. After multiple failed attempts in the past, we finally got the GPS module to work. The issue wasn’t with wiring but the absence of serial output and the fact that satellite signals couldn’t reach us indoors. Once we stepped outside, the GPS began returning location data within a couple of minutes, an important lesson on environmental dependencies in IoT hardware testing. We began exploring how to connect the solar panel, charge controller, and battery pack to our ESP32 system, referencing schematics and pin diagrams for future setup. Although we didn’t have a battery to complete the solar configuration, we now have a solid understanding of how it integrates and how we can eventually log battery voltage to Firebase for real-time monitoring. We reinforced Firebase concepts like authentication, logging, and database structure through our UID tracking system with RFID.

blockers: |
   We couldn’t complete the solar panel test due to the unavailability of a Li-ion battery. This halted power testing via the charge controller. Our ESP32 Wi-Fi code interfered with the RFID module, which we resolved by disabling Firebase temporarily during testing.

reflection: |
  Today was a huge step forward. Seeing both the RFID and GPS modules finally work after earlier setbacks was a morale boost for the whole group. It reminded us that hardware isn’t just about plugging things in but it’s about persistence, debugging, and context. The RFID integration felt particularly rewarding since we could see data we created arriving in the serial monitor. The groundwork we laid with the solar power system puts us in a strong position to finish the coupling phase of our project confidently once the battery arrives.
