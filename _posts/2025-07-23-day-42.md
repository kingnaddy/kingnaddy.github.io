what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on completing and editing our elevator pitch video. After some back-and-forth on whether to include captions, the team reached a consensus that satisfied everyone. Our faculty mentor reviewed the final product and was impressed with the quality and clarity of the message. We submitted the video a day early

  I also began contributing meaningfully to the research paper. My assigned sections were the Introduction and Results. I structured the introduction into four parts—background & motivation, problem statement & research gap, project objectives, and paper organization. I completed the first three sections and Kambili volunteered to handle the objectives section. I plan to begin writing the results section tomorrow and run the introduction draft by the writing center before uploading it to Overleaf.

reflection: |
  Today was productive on multiple fronts and highlighted the different dimensions this project demands—from visual communication to academic writing. Seeing the final elevator pitch come together reminded me how impactful clarity and team synchronization can be. Writing the research paper introduction pushed me to translate weeks of technical work into a scholarly narrative. This required me to slow down, research deeply, and explain concepts in a way that aligns with academic standards. I’m more confident now in my ability to contribute to published research and articulate the value of what we’ve built.
