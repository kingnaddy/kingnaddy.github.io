what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on completing and editing our elevator pitch video. After some back-and-forth on whether to include captions, the team reached a consensus that satisfied everyone. Our faculty mentor reviewed the final product and was impressed with the quality and clarity of the message.

  I also began contributing meaningfully to the research paper. My assigned sections were the Introduction and Results. I structured the introduction into four parts—background & motivation, problem statement & research gap, project objectives, and paper organization. I completed the first three sections and Kambili volunteered to handle the objectives section. I plan to begin writing the results section tomorrow and run the introduction draft by the writing center before uploading it to Overleaf.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me of the importance of team compromise and steady academic pacing. The video success was a team win and a reminder that clear storytelling matters as much as technical depth. Writing the introduction helped crystallize the broader context and significance of our work—it’s more than just coding, it’s solving a real-world problem.
