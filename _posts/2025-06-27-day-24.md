what_i_learned: |
  I was responsible for preparing our weekly project summary slide where I communicated the overall purpose, technologies used like ESP32, sensors, and ML, and the intended impact of our system in a clear and concise way.  We completed and submitted our weekly video update and aside from a minor mic issue with the high school teacher everything went smoothly. We encountered and resolved a crash with our RFID Firebase Arduino integration because of a deprecated line in the MFRC522 library and replacing the line fixed the compilation issue. We successfully integrated Firebase with multiple sensors including RFID, ultrasonic, and GPS and verified that sensor outputs like UID, fill level, and location were correctly logged in the real time database. We went outdoors to test the GPS component and after about 2 minutes it acquired a satellite lock and streamed accurate latitude and longitude data into Firebase. We couldn’t test the solar system integration again because we still don’t have a Li-ion battery but we’re fully prepared to hook it up once the component arrives.

blockers: |
  We still do not have the required battery to test the solar power setup which is halting our energy autonomy goal. The RFID Firebase code originally failed to compile because of outdated syntax in the Arduino library which delayed our testing by around 10 minutes.

reflection: |
  I feel really proud of our progress today. Having all our major sensors RFID, ultrasonic, and GPS connected and actively logging to Firebase made this feel like a real smart system in motion. It was satisfying to see raw sensor data transformed into meaningful timestamped entries in the cloud. Also writing the project summary slide helped me reflect on how far we’ve come and how clearly our goals align with sustainable tech. Once we plug in the solar component we’ll have a near complete prototype that actually works in the real world.
