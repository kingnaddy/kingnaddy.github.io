what_i_learned: |
  I explored the origins of Generative AI, learned how large language models are trained, and understood key deep learning concepts. I generated AI-driven content using Character AI, Suno AI Music, and Llama Labs, gaining insight into creative AI applications. I practiced tokenization and embeddings workflows, and wrote my first prompt engineering experiments to guide model outputs. In a group activity, I honed my critical eye by distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones and discussing detection cues. I applied Python skills to complete exercises and two labs, reinforcing dictionary use and file I/O patterns.

blockers: |
  I missed handling the “word not found” case in one exercise, which the instructor helped me catch. In my lab code I initially forgot to open the file before processing, leading to an error that I then fixed. I failed a question in the second Kahoot game which stopped me from finishing in the top 10 (broke my heart- I'm super competitive).

reflection: |
  Today’s Generative AI session opened my eyes to the creative possibilities of LLMs and multimedia generators. I had a lot of fun with the Kahoot as well, proud that 102 took home the crown in both rounds. Debugging my Python lab reminded me to always anticipate edge cases and take proper care of them. I’m excited to build on these skills tomorrow by exploring advanced prompt techniques and refining my code robustness.
